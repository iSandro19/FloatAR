    <string name="help_text_title">Welcome to the FloatAR Help Screen!</string>
    <string name="help_text_content">
        FloatAR is an application that allows you to play Battleship in single-player mode against AI and in real-time online multiplayer mode through rooms. It also includes a demo where you can see one of the fleet ships and a simple and intuitive ship placement system on the board. Here are the functionalities in a more precise way:\n\n

        Single-player mode: To play alone, you can access the single-player mode where you will face a simple AI. To do this, you will have to design your fleet in the creator once you access this mode. The procedure is simple, as we can choose the position of the ships through buttons to select the ship type and orientation. By clicking on the board, we will add a ship, and depending on whether we are in vertical or horizontal mode, the ship will be placed downwards or to the right. To start playing once we confirm the game board, we just have to click on the new board that will appear to attack the opponent. The smaller board on top will be theirs, and we can see how the game is progressing. It is important to note that blue blocks represent their ships, gray blocks represent water hits, and red blocks represent hits on ships. At the end of the game, a new screen will appear with the victory or defeat message and a button to return to the main screen.\n\n

        Multiplayer mode: By accessing this mode, you will have the possibility to create a new room or join an existing one. The rooms have space for 2 players, and once the game ends or the players leave, all the information of the game will be deleted from the server. The process to create the board is identical to the single-player mode, as well as the gameplay. The only difference is the establishment of turns and an inactivity timer that can lead to the elimination of the room. Once the game ends, the room is deleted, and the result is displayed for each player (victory or defeat).\n\n

        Augmented Reality Demonstration: Due to time constraints, we could not develop a game mode that uses this technology, so we opted to create a small example. By accessing this mode, you can place a warship from the fleet on a surface, which will be seen through the mobile device.\n\n

        We hope this help screen has been useful to you. Have fun playing with FloatAR!
