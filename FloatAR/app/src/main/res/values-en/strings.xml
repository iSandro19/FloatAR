    <string name="help_text_content">
        FloatAR is an augmented reality application to play the popular game Battleship.
        The application allows you to place ships on a virtual board and compete against other players
        in real-time. Here are some key features of the application:\n\n

        \t\t - Augmented Reality Board: The application utilizes augmented reality technology to
        simulate a real-time board. To start playing, simply point your device
        towards a flat surface and follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the boards position.\n\n

        \t\t - Gesture-Based Ship Placement: Once the board is set up, you can place your ships on the
        virtual board using on-screen gestures. Drag and drop the ships to the desired position,
        and use pinch gestures to rotate and resize them.\n\n
        and use pinch gestures to rotate and resize them.\n\n

        \t\t - Collision Detection: The application features a collision detection system to ensure that
        ships do not overlap on the virtual board. If you try to place a ship in an invalid position,
        the application will alert you and prompt you to move it.\n\n

        \t\t - Gameplay System: Once both players have placed their ships, the game can begin.
        Fire at your opponents ships by clicking on the squares of the board, and
        use the applications indicators to see if you hit or miss. Your opponent can also
        fire at your ships, so make sure to protect them well.\n\n

        \t\t - Detecting Wins and Losses: The application includes a system to detect wins
        and losses. The first player to sink all of the opponents ships wins the game.\n\n

        \t\t - Real-Time Scoring and Game Status: The application displays real-time scoring and
        game status for both players. Use these indicators to plan your moves and
        stay updated on the progress of the game.\n\n

        \t\t - Explosion and Missile Launch Animations: The application features animations
        to show ship explosions and missile launches from one side to another.
        These animations bring the game to life and make it more exciting.\n\n

        \t\t - Ship Customization: The application allows you to customize the appearance of your
        ships to suit your style. Change the color and shape of your ships to
        make them unique and recognizable.\n\n

        We hope this help screen has been useful to you. Have fun playing with FloatAR!
